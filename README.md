## Installation

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/check-contrast.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on check-contrast.sketchplugin

## What it does
Opens a panel so that you can view the colour contrast ratio and pick colours at the same time.

You can select a single layer and this plugin will do it's best to pick out the background layer's colour for you.

If you have two colours for checking then you can select two layers and the plugin will check for you.

## Inspiration of design
A designer on my team thought it was tedious to have to toggle a command when choosing a colour each time to check the contrast. During exploration it is easier to choose a colour and get realtime feedback.

I thought what if it we brought back a bit of Winamp skins style in this day and age and if it is even possible ü§î. Found this [Winamp Sketch file by Anja van Staden](https://dribbble.com/shots/4297593-Winamp-Skin) and was able to make the UI in Sketch with HTML/CSS.
